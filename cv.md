## About me
I have little experience as a layout designer, now I work as a junior front-end developer in a small IT startup. I want to improve my knowledge of javascript. Since the IT is developing very quickly, I think this phrase is very suitable: 
>You need to run as fast just to stay in place, and to get somewhere, you need to run at least twice as fast! (Alice in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll)
So I try not to stand still.

## My skills
* HTML
* CSS/SCSS/Tailwind CSS
* Javascript (basic)
* Vue.js (basic)
* Gulp
* Git
* Figma

## Code examples

```javascript
function betterThanAverage(classPoints, yourPoints) {
  classPoints.push(yourPoints);
  const summOfPoints = classPoints.reduce((acc, point)=> acc + point, 0);
  const average = summOfPoints / classPoints.length;
  if (yourPoints > average) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
};
```
